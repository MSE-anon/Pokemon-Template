This is a Pokemon Template for Magic Set Editor. Currently only Modern Style is supported. Eventually I want to add Delta Species and HGSS-era cards but that may be a long while before that is added.

BEFORE RUNNING PROGRAM INSTALL THE 4 FONTS INCLUDED!!!

Current Version: 2015-11-10

### Useful Info ###
Here is a list of text codes for the stuff.
Shift + A - Ability
Shift + C - Colorless
Shift + D - Dark
Shift + R - Fire
Shift + F - Fightning
Shift + W - Water
Shift + P - Psychic
Shift + M - Metal
Shift + G - Grass
Shift + Y - Fairy
Shift + L - Lightning

These codes only work for the Attack Cost and Weakness/Resistance. Dragon is not programmed. I realize this now. It'll be available soon.

Set Icon size is 15x15

### Known Issues ###
Pretty much everything. This template is barely 20% comlete. If even.

- Only Basic Pokemon work right now. You're also only allowed two moves. No EX's.
- There's a lot of minor text misplacement and font size issues. I tried to get it as close as I can for now. I was really focusing on placement in the beginning.
- Dark and Dragon cards use white font. This is a little complex to code so I'm still working on it.
- Rarity symbols haven't been implemented yet.
